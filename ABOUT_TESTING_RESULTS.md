## Understanding

- This report only summarizes artifacts downloaded into this workflow run.
- RSS means resident set size: physical memory pages currently resident for the process.
- PeakBytes is the process-level peak resident memory (high-water RSS) for the full run.
- BeforeRSS/AfterRSS are per-test resident-memory snapshots; DeltaRSS is AfterRSS minus BeforeRSS.
- BeforeHeap/AfterHeap are allocator-managed heap snapshots; DeltaHeap is AfterHeap minus BeforeHeap.
- PeakAfterTest is the process peak resident memory observed after a specific test completed.
- LimitBytes is the configured memory threshold for the run.
- LimitExceeded means measured memory crossed LimitBytes.
- LimitEnforced means crossing LimitBytes should mark that run as failed/gated.
- Experimental compile failures are reported separately and do not gate the main host simulation lanes.
- Experimental compile metrics track each library/backend/optional combination discovered in the experimental lane.
- ProbeElementsAtStop and ProbeCurrentBytesAtStop come from the optional capacity probe.
- FirstLimitCrossingTest is the first test whose per-test memory reached or exceeded the run limit.
- If FirstLimitCrossingTest is blank, no per-test crossing was found (or no per-test stats were present).
