# ArrayList Class

The `ArrayList` class is a C++ template class that provides an implementation of a ArrayList for easy storing of a Value of any designated type. It allows you to efficiently store and retrieve data using indexes, similar to an ArrayList in Java.

## Overview

The `ArrayList` class is designed to offer a dynamic and scalable ArrayList with the following features:

- **Dynamic Sizing**: The List can dynamically resizes itself when the ArrayList becomes full. (This is the default behavior)
- **Fixed Size**: The List can remain a fixed size when specified in the constructor. (Must Be Passed into the Constructor, otherwise the list will be dynamic)
- **Iterator Support**: You can iterate through the Values in the List.

## WARNING: This Library Utilizes POINTERS * to Memory. This is due to the Libraries ability to utilize any return type. (Bool, String, int, float, etc)

## ADDITIONAL WARNING: Please Ensure you have initialized the Serial Interface (Serial.begin()) before using debug mode. 

### GENERAL INFO: 
This library is heavily based around the Java ArrayList Class. Almost all functions contained inside Java's ArrayList class have been implemented in this library. This does ***NOT*** mean it behaves exactly the same way. Some functions, due to the fact that they were designed for Arduino, are super simplistic in design. This means that sometimes, instead of returning a value, the library may just display a message instead. (ONLY IN DEBUG MODE). Please be Mindful of this behavior. If you are having issues with the library, please pass the debug boolean into the constructor, and keep track of the libraries output. This will be useful when reporting a bug. Thank you!
- Brayden Anderson (Developer)

### Key Features

- `Constructor(SizeType type, size_t initialSize, bool debug)`: Creates a new Instance of the ArrayList object (Debug enables the Serial Print statements. This is set to false by default so if you do not pass a true value in, no Print statements from this library should happen).
- `Destructor()` : Destructs the Instance of the library/ library object
- `add(T item)`: Adds an Item to a List
- `addAll(const ArrayList<T>& other)` : Add all elements from a different ArrayList into the current ArrayList
- `addAll(const T* other, size_t length)` : Add all elements from a different List type. Utilizes a pointer to that particular List.
- `insert(size_t index, T item)` : Insert an item at a certain index.
- `insertAll(size_t index, const ArrayList<T>& other)` : Inserts all elements of a different ArrayList into a certain start index, then moves to the next index until all items have been added.
- `insertAll(size_t index, const T* other, size_t length)` : Inserts all elements of a different list type (Utilizing a pointer) into a certain start index, then moves to the next index until all items have been added.
- `removeItem(T item)` : Removes an element by utilizing the actual element you want to remove.
- `removeIf(bool (*predicate)(T)) ` : Remove an item if the condition is true
- `removeRange(size_t fromIndex, size_t toIndex)` : Removes items from a specified start index to a specified end index.
- `retainAll(const ArrayList<T>& other)` : Removes all Elements in the ArrayList that do not match the ArrayList in the argument.
- `remove(size_t index)`: Removes the value stored at the specified index.
- `clear()`: Clears all values in the list.
- `contains(T item)` : Returns `true` if an element is contained inside the ArrayList or `false` if it is not.
- `indexOf(T item)` : Returns the index of the specified item.
- `capacity()`: Returns the capacity of the list.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the list is empty.
- `set(size_t index, T item)` : Replaces the item stored at a certain index. Otherwise it adds it in.
- `replaceAll(T (*operatorFunction)(T)) ` : Replaces All items in the ArrayList with the result of applying a specified function to each element.
- `forEach(void (*consumer)(T))` : Type of Iterator that allows you to perform certain Functions as it Iterates.
- `toArray(T* outputArray)` : Transforms an ArrayList to a normal Array.
- `sublist(size_t fromIndex, size_t toIndex)` : Creates a new List out of the specified index range.
- `clone()` : Clones the ArrayList.
- `clone(int initialCapacity)` : Clones the Arraylist... The clone will have the specified default capacity.
- `ensureCapacity(size_t minCapacity)` : resizes the ArrayList to the specified capacity.
- `trimToSize()` : This method is used to trim the capacity of an ArrayList instance to the list's current size (capacity of the ArrayList will be set to the number of elements currently stored)
- `sort(bool (*comparator)(T, T))` : Chooses which sort algorithm to use based off the current set Algorithm
- `sort(bool (*comparator)(T, T), SortAlgorithm algorithm) ` : Chooses which sort algorithm to use based off of the specified sort algorithm.
- `setSortAlgorithm(SortAlgorithm algorithm = MERGE_SORT)`: Set the global Sort Algorithm
- `getSortAlgorithm()` : Gets the Global Sort Algorithm
- `mergeSort(ArrayList<T>& list, int l, int r)`
- `quickSort(bool (*comparator)(T, T))`
-` bubbleSort(bool (*comparator)(T, T))`
- `resize()` : Private function: resizes the List
- `resize2()`: Private function that resizes the List. This is slower then the resize() function but more accurate. [DEFAULT]
- `removeAt(T item)` : Private Function: Removes an item at the index specified (remove function utilizes this function to work)
- `swap(T* a, T* b)`
- `merge(ArrayList<T>& list, int l, int m, int r)`
- `quickSortHelper(bool (*comparator)(T, T), int low, int high) `
- `partition(bool (*comparator)(T, T), int low, int high)`

#### Specific Iterator Functions
- `begin()` : Defines the Iterator Start Position
- `end()` : Defines the Iterator Stop Position

#### Sort Options:
- BUBBLE_SORT 
- QUICK_SORT 
- MERGE_SORT

### Size Types:
- FIXED: Fixed size list that cannot be resized
- DYNAMIC: Dynamically resizes the list based off of the capacity and size factors.
- DYNAMIC2: More Reliable then DYNAMIC, but it is technically slower. [DEFAULT]


#### **Please Note, You can use a Simple for-loop instead of the iterator. It will work the same. The iterator is only there for those who like to utilize them**

```
instead of
```cpp
this -> sizeType = list.sizeType;
```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `ArrayList` class:

```cpp
#include <ArrayList.h>
#include <Arduino.h>
ArrayList<int> List(ArrayList<int>::DYNAMIC, 10); // ORIGINAL Default option, this uses memcpy to copy data from 1 array to another while resizing.
ArrayList<String> myList(ArrayList<String>::FIXED, 10); // Fixed size, with a size of 10 [CANNOT RESIZE AT ALL!!!!]
ArrayList<double> doubleList(ArrayList<double>::DYNAMIC2, 10); //DEFAULT OPTION: Specifies the use of resize2() function which is more reliable {BUT SLOWER!!!} 
ArrayList<bool> boolList;

int main() {
    List.add("Hello");
    List.add("World");
    List.add("!");

    for(int i = 0; i < 25; i ++){
        myList.add(i);
    }

    boolList.add(true);
    boolList.add(false);
    boolList.add(true);
    boolList.add(true);
    boolList.add(false);

    for(int i = 0; i < List.size(); i++){
        Serial.println(List.get(i));
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < myList.size(); i++){
        Serial.println(myList.get(i));
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < boolList.size(); i++){
        Serial.println(boolList.get(i));
    }



}

```
