sentence=A Simple ArrayList Implementation that saves memory by dumping contents into an SD Card.
paragraph=Built on the ArrayList Library, This Library allows you to use in Memory Lists, Or it will save all elements to an SD Card. Just a fair Warning, SD cards are Slower then In Memory applications. Which means it can take a sec for it to load an element from the sdcard.
